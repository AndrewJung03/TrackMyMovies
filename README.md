# Track My Movies

## Overview

According to data collected by Popflick, the average American wathces 6 movies a year (at the theatres). Over time, that adds up to a lot of movies and it's easy to forget what youâ€™ve seen, which ones you loved, or how you'd rate them. That's what Track My Movies is for!

Track My Movies is a web app that allows users to create an account and keep track of all the movies they've watched. Users can add movies to their watchlist with posters, write personal notes, and rate each film. Additionally, users can explore other users' profiles to discover what movies others have been watching and see their ratings and reviews. 


## Data Model

The application will store Users, and Movies

* user has a list of movies that they've watched with multiple movies (via refrences)
* each movie has a rating, notes, and a cover image

An Example User:

```javascript
{
  username: "movieEnjoyer99",
  hash: // a password hash,
  moviesWatched: references to Movie documents
}
```

An Example Movie with Embedded Items:

```javascript
{
  user: ,// a reference to a User object
  title: "Tenet",
  picture: //URL to movie poster
  review: 5,
  note: "Meh",
  release: "09/03/2020",
  addedOn: "10/23/24"
}
```
